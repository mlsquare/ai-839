# ML Documentation
Google published [Model Cards for Model Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993) to improve transparency in model reporting. Idea is very similar to how information related to the nutritional content is published on the packaging. See their [blog](https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/about) for details. Similar efforts were made to document the details about the data too. See [Data Cards: Purposeful and Transparent Dataset Documentation for Responsible AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01075) for details and the accompanying blog with playbook [here](https://research.google/blog/the-data-cards-playbook-a-toolkit-for-transparency-in-dataset-documentation/) from Google Research.

Both Model Card and Data Card only capture "_an_" aspect of the entire problem but at a greater depth. Both of them are reporting aspects most useful in _post_ deployment scenarios. But what about _during_ development? In particular, given the exploratory and iterative nature of ML model and system development, how do we give structure to this process as well as document it?

# AI Canvas
[AI-Canvas](https://hbr.org/2018/04/a-simple-tool-to-start-making-decisions-with-the-help-of-ai) fills the gap on the business side during the _Design_ phase of the development. However, the terminology is used somewhat OOD for ML folks and is not easy to get it right in first pass :).

[Project Canvas](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/product-design/#template) is more elaborate and easier to understand than _AI Canvas_. But again, the terming _Project_ can made specific and unambiguous. 

That leads to project cards.

# Project Cards

The purpose of Project Cards is two folds:

1. During development helps the developer think about the problem in a structured way w.r. t framing the problem, assessing the business value, viability, and many other aspects. 

2. It can also serve as a document giving a high level overview of the system developed and deployed. With proper versioning, one can also see the evolution of the problem. It is meant to be a high level document and as details emerge, documents such Model Cards and Data Cards can be linked. 

The following are the different sections of the Project Cards.

## Business View
It focusses on the following questions:

- What is the problem being solved?
- Who is the customer?
- Why it needs to be solved?
- How does the solution like - a mental or a conceptual model or a mock of the product?
- What objectives does it achieve?
- What are the risks and challenges?

## ML view
It is bit more in-depth focussing on the execution will have the following questions:

- What is the prediction problem?
- How the objective will be measured?
- How will it be tested?
- Data: What kind, how and how much and what for?
- What is the roadmap/plan?
- What resources are needed - both human, compute and admin?

Above points are put in a [Project Card Template](./resources/project-card.ipynb) which is Jupyter notebook.
