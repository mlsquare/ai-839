Date: Tuesday, 27-Aug-2024.

### Pre-work:
1. Review [Diagnostics of ML Systems](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tuCIbk9Pye-RK1xqiiZXPzT8lIgDUL6CqBkFSYZXkbY/edit?usp=sharing) from [CS329s](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/) 


### In-Class

1. Recap tests for monitoring data quality in the ETL stage
2. Understand different types of drifts (label, covariate, concept) and ways to detect them that may be important in the model development stage
3. Collecting data in the training stage - see [Training Data](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OYjrmhSBu3Poo5FcY6WywpU_eR7mtkpe1r8nbbWvArg/edit?usp=sharing), from [CS329s](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/)
4. [Data Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723) - programmatically create labels. [snorkel](https://www.snorkel.org/) introduced these ideas first in the NLP space.
5. Synthetic Data Generation using LLMs is a very promising and emerging application LLMs. For example, we can create labels of a piece of text, by prompting LLMs.

### Post-class:
1. Review [Training Data](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OYjrmhSBu3Poo5FcY6WywpU_eR7mtkpe1r8nbbWvArg/edit?usp=sharing), from [CS329s](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/)
2. Review [Feature Engineering](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OYjrmhSBu3Poo5FcY6WywpU_eR7mtkpe1r8nbbWvArg/edit?usp=sharing), from [CS329s](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/)
