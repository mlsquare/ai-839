### Pre-work:
1. [Lesson 2](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat503/lesson/2) of Stat503 on planning a simple comparative experiment

### In-Class
1. Review sample size calculation in t-test. How sample size is a function of  data quality, confidence, and tolerance for errors in the conclusions. Except in simple cases, getting a good sense of the "how much data" is a hard, rather very hard question. But we can try.
2. Myth Buster - more data is better
    - it is like a tautology. this notion never gets challenged. More data does not lead to better RoI. In fact, more of the same can never improve performance beyond a point or in some specific cases, it is impossible.
    - law of diminishing returns. collecting more data can not only be expensive but can saturate, reaching a plateau. In fact, collecting data to understand where this plateau and what is the ceiling is, is an interesting problem in itself. A well designed experiment can address this question.
3. Can we estimate the sample size needed?
    - back of the envelope calculations based on _some_ idea about the data, based on two-sample sample size calculations
    - from PAC theory bounds (Chapter 8 of  [An Elementary Introduction to Statistical Learning Theory](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118023471))
    - empirical scaling laws
4. How to recruit data? Are all individual data points equal?
    - active learning
    - [cords](https://github.com/decile-team/cords) for a collection of works/implementations based on subset selection
