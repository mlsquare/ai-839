## HW-02 {#sec-hw-02}

**Reading**

- Data Cards: Purposeful and Transparent Dataset Documentation for Responsible AI[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01075) [blog](https://research.google/blog/the-data-cards-playbook-a-toolkit-for-transparency-in-dataset-documentation/) from Google Research.

**Task**

- Download the [soybean](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=1023) tabular dataset with dataset id 1023 from [openML](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active). 
- Make sure that a repo is already created (as you would have done in HW-01) with _repo name_ "your first name-ai-839" and git handle _dhavala_ is given read and write access.  
- Create a new branch name _hw02_
- Under notebooks folder, create a new notebook with markdown and cell tags to implement Data Cards.
- Using [pymfe](https://github.com/ealcobaca/pymfe), include some useful properties of the dataset in the Data Card Make sure that when any changes in the dataset get reflected automatically and the Data Card is updated automatically.
